**OVERVIEW**

At JMT I was tasked with monitoring H2S (Hydrogen Sulfide) at multiple manhole locations for one of our clients. While manual methods using excel were techinically doable, however as the data great larger over many monitors, it proved to be inefficently in calculating useful insights and visualizations.

I took the intiative to use my Data Engineering to drastically improvement workflow efficiency by over 100%, store the final data in a more initutive fashion, and create detailed visualization that were no possible via excel or other manual methods.
The final result created positive feedback from our client due to significantly improve visualizations and results. With this pipeline being succesfull, I was able to use similar ETL methodologies on other project as well to once again improve workload and visualizations.
