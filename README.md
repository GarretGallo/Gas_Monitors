**OVERVIEW**

At JMT, I was tasked with monitoring H2S (Hydrogen Sulfide) at multiple manhole locations for one of our clients. While manual methods using Excel were technically doable, as the data grew larger over many monitors, it proved to be inefficient in calculating useful insights and visualizations.
I took the initiative to use my data engineering knowledge to drastically improve workflow efficiency by over 100%, store the final data in a more intuitive fashion, and create detailed visualizations that were not possible via Excel or other manual methods. The final product resulted in positive feedback from our client due to significantly improved visualizations and results. With this pipeline being successful, I was able to use similar ETL methodologies on other projects as well to once again improve workload and visualizations.
